1. Building the raspberry pi circuit. -Evans and Malik
  -Ensure that the circuit is able to run properly.
  -Ensure that the current of electricity flows through python without mistakes.
  -Ensure that the sensor works properly. 

2. Configuring the raspberry pi- Malik
  -Install python w1thermsensor library and adafruit library.
  -Import w1thermsensor.
  -Import time. 
  -Import sys.
  -Import Adafruit_DHT.


3. enabling the interface- Evans
  -Connect the sensor to python throw the yellow serial wire. 
  -Let the raspberry pi know that we are connecting it to python through this pin by Raspberry Pi Configuration tool, 
  found in the Preferences menu.

4. Creating the temperature sensor- Malik
  -Install the sensor into python.
  -Ensure that the code for the sensor runs with no errors thrown back.

5. creating the display document- Evans
  -Ensuring that the time, temperature and humdity is displayed correctly.

6. Writing the code- Malik
  -Create while loop to make sure that the sensor detects the temperature every second and posts it onto the display document.
  -Python 3 Editor is to be used.

7. store the sensor information in sensor. -Evans
  -Create an object called sensor to store the data from w1thermsensor.

8. Store the temperature information. -Malik
  -Create an object called sensor to store the data from get.temperature().
  -Ensure that the sensor is taking the temperature with every click.

9. Store the humidity information in humidity. -Evans
  -Create an object called humidity.
  -ensure that the humidity readings are correct and running with every click. 
  
10.Go over each step to make sure everything works as it's supposed to. (Malik and Evans)
