#Step number 1: Building the raspberry pi circuit. -Evans and Malik
-ensure that the circuit is able to run properly.
-ensure that the current of electricity flows through python without mistakes.
-ensure that the sensor works properly. 

#step number 2: Configuring the raspberry pi- Malik
-install python w1thermsensor library and adafruit library.
-import w1thermsensor.
-import time. 
-import sys.
-import Adafruit_DHT.


#step number 3: enabling the interface- Evans
-Connect the sensor to python throw the yellow serial wire. 
-let the raspberry pi know that we are connecting it to python through this pin by Raspberry Pi Configuration tool, 
found in the Preferences menu.

#step number 4: Creating the temperature sensor- Malik
-install the sensor into python.
-ensure that the code for the sensor runs with no errors thrown back.

#step number 5: creating the display document- Evans
-ensuring that the time, temperature and humdity is displayed correctly.

#step number 6: Writing the code- Malik
-Create while loop to make sure that the sensor detects the temperature every second and posts it onto the display document.
-Python 3 Editor is to be used.

#Step number 7: store the sensor information in sensor. -Evans
-Create an object called sensor to store the data from w1thermsensor.

#Step number 8: Store the temperature information. -Malik
-Create an object called sensor to store the data from get.temperature().
-Ensure that the sensor is taking the temperature with every click.

Step number 9: Store the humidity information in humidity. -Evans
-Create an object called humidity.
-ensure that the humidity readings are correct and running with every click.
